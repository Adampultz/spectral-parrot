A Parrot can be built in many ways. This is how I've done it:

Body:

A wooden board of dimensions 115 x 40 x 1.8 cm
Alternatively, a woooden box of similar length and width

Motors: 8 stepper motors — Nema 17 with a gear ration of 5:1. I use the model 17HS19-1684S-PG5 which I've bought on omc-stepperonline.com
Motor brackets: I use the model ST-M1, also from omc-stepperonline.com
Strick brackets:

On either side, two aluminum L-brackets bolted together to form an S-shape that hosts the motors and tuners
