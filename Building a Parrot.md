A Parrot can be built in many ways. This is how I've done it:

Body:

A wooden board of dimensions 115 x 40 x 1.8 cm. 
Alternatively, a woooden box of similar length and width.

Motors: 8 stepper motors — Nema 17 with a gear ration of 5:1. I use the model 17HS19-1684S-PG5 which I've bought on omc-stepperonline.com. 
Motor brackets: I use the model ST-M1, also from omc-stepperonline.com. 
Tuners: Göldo bass tuners. 
Transducers: I use two Visaton EX 80 S 8Ohm 50W transducer.  
Amplifier for your transducers: I use an SMSL 50 W amp.  
Aluminum brackets: On either side, two aluminum L-brackets bolted together to form an S-shape that hosts the motors and tuners. The dimensions of each part are 80x60x6 mm and 100x100x6 mm. Each has a lentgh of 40 cm.
